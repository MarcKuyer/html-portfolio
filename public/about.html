  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, nice that you are viewing my website. My name is Marc and I am currently taking an online Web development course. Here I show you what I have learned so far.</p>

  <p>I have always found web development very interesting. In the past I have taken courses for HTML and CSS but never really did anything with them. 
  I came across the course The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Instagram and my interest was immediately aroused. 
  With this course I refresh my HTML and CSS knowledge and I also learn JavaScript, something I have not done before.</p>
